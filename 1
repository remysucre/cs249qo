Below are a list of papers we will read, in order.

There is a final project that accounts for 100% of your grade.
Please send your GitHub user name to Remy to access a list of
project ideas, and feel free to schedule a meeting to discuss
your project further.

To help you keep your project on track, you are encouraged
to send weekly progress updates to Remy.
There is no fixed format, you can just informally describe
what you have done over the week.
