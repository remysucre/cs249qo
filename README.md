This is a graduate-level research-oriented course offered in Winter 2025.
The course aims to introduce foundation knowledge and discuss recent advances
in query optimization. Another goal of the course is to teach the students
how to effectively read research papers.  The course contains lecture time by
the instructor covering basics of query optimization, and guided discussion
on foundational and cutting-edge research. The students are expected to conduct
a research project in related topics.

## Prerequisites

The students are expected to be familiar with the inner workings of relational
databases, including the relational algebra, basics of query optimization, cost
estimation, and query execution.

## Grading

The research project takes up 100% of the grade.
Please send your GitHub user name to the instructor to access a list of
project ideas, and feel free to schedule a meeting to discuss
your project further.
The students are encouraged to
send weekly progress updates on their project to the instructor to ensure they
are on track to completion.
There is no fixed format, you can just informally describe
what you have done over the week.

Below are a list of papers we will read, in order.
